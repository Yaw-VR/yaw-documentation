# Infuse VR
Infuse VR is a cutting-edge application designed for streaming VR content from a PC to wireless headsets like Meta Quest and Pico. It also offers motion compensation and comprehensive hand and gaming accessory visualization, making it an ideal solution for VR enthusiasts.

**Important Note:** Infuse VR can be used independently of the Yaw Motion Simulator and is compatible with third-party motion software such as Sim Racing Studio.
