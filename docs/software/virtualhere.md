# VirtualHere

## Overview

There is no direct USB connection between the Yaw simulator and your PC. However, VirtualHere is pre-installed on the Yaw simulator, enabling you to remotely access USB devices connected to the simulator over a network as if they were locally connected.

To complete the setup, you need to install the client application on your PC and connect it to the Yaw simulator's IP address. Once connected, you will be able to use any USB devices connected to the simulator just as if they were directly plugged into your PC.

[Game Link / Settings / Miscellaneous](gamelink.md#settings) now has a default setting to manage VirtualHere client. But if you wish to manually install it, follow the instructions below. A reason to manually install it would be if you use other motion software with your simulator.

## Server Setup

The server is already pre-installed and running on the Yaw simulator. You do not need to perform any additional setup on the server side.

## Client Installation

### Windows

1. Download and run the VirtualHere client from <a href="https://www.virtualhere.com/usb_client_software" target="_blank">VirtualHere website</a>.
2. Connect to the Yaw simulator's IP address using the VirtualHere client.
3. You should now see all USB devices connected to the simulator in the VirtualHere client window.
4. To connect a device to your PC right click on it in the VirtualHere client window, from the menu that appears select **Use** for the current session, or **Auto-Use Device** to have it always connect automatically.
