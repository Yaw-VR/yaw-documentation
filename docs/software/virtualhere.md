# VirtualHere

**VirtualHere** is a remote USB device management tool pre-installed on Yaw simulators. It enables users to access USB devices connected to the simulator over a network, making them appear as if they were directly connected to their PC. To complete the setup, users must install the client application on their PC and connect it to the Yaw simulator's IP address.

## Key Benefits:

* Seamless remote access to USB devices
* Easy installation and connection process
* Compatible with various operating systems

**Note:** The [Game Link / Settings / Miscellaneous](gamelink.md#settings) section now includes a default setting for managing the VirtualHere client. However, manual installation may be necessary for users who utilize other motion software with their simulator.

## Server Setup

The VirtualHere server is already pre-installed and running on the Yaw simulator.
