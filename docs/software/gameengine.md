# Game Engine

## Overview

**Game Engine** is a specialized tool designed to seamlessly connect VR games to Yaw VR motion simulators, enabling immersive gaming experiences with minimal setup. Unlike middleware solutions like SimTools, Yaw VR Game Engine simplifies the process, allowing users to connect games to the simulator with a few clicks and without additional cost.

**Note:** Game Engine can be used with a Yaw VR Motion Simulator, or the [Yaw VR Emulator](./yawvremu.md).

### Key Features:
1. **Game Integration**: Supports a growing list of popular VR and PC games, such as *Microsoft Flight Simulator*, *Assetto Corsa*, *Dirt 2*, *Elite Dangerous*, and more. If your game isnâ€™t supported, you can request integration from the developers.
2. **User-Friendly Setup**: Users simply start the simulator, launch the game engine, and then play their desired game. The tool also supports motion customization, including yaw, pitch, roll, and other dynamics.
3. **Advanced Controls**: It allows adjustment of motion parameters, such as smoothing inputs, amplifying vibrations, and even configuring LED lighting effects on the simulator.
4. **Free and Flexible**: The software is free to download and use, with ongoing updates to expand game compatibility.

The engine also provides SDKs for Unity and Unreal, enabling developers to build native support into their games.
