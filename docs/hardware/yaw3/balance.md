# Balancing the Simulator

As you add peripherals and your own body weight the centre of balance may change, there is a place to add weight plates behind the seat to counter-balance the added load. This adjustment helps maintain stability and control during operation.

Your aim is that the chair maintains neutral balance when you are sitting in the seat while the simulator is powered off.

The maximum diameter of weight plates you can fit in this area is 240mm, the maximum height of combined weight plates using the provided holding bolt is 44mm.

3D models that help keep the both Olympic and Non-olympic weight plates centrally located so they don't move side were created by ItsVRK and are freely available at <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/632564" target="_blank">Yaw 3 Motion Simulator Weight Plate Guide</a>.
