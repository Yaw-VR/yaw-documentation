# USB Peripherals

After setting up the [VirtualHere client](../../software/virtualhere.md) on your PC, connect your USB peripherals by plugging them into the available USB ports at the rear of the simulator.

## Using a powered USB Hub

The simulator allows for up to 4 USB devices plugged directly into it, if you have more then we suggest purchasing a powered USB hub. This will allow you to connect more than 4 devices without overloading the power supply of the simulator.

## Connecting Devices

With the simulator powered on, once connected, USB devices should be recognized by the VirtualHere client running on your PC. If they do not appear immediately, try unplugging and replugging them or restarting the VirtualHere client.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with USB device recognition:

1. Ensure that the VirtualHere client is up to date.
2. Check for any driver updates for your USB devices.
3. Try connecting the devices directly to a PC to ensure they are functioning correctly.
4. Restart both the simulator and your PC.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully connect and use your USB peripherals with the yaw3 simulator.
